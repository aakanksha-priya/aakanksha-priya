## 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

Welcome to my GitHub profile.  
This space reflects my **hands-on work, learning journey, and technical skill development in Data Analytics**, supported by a computer science background and real-world project experience.

---

## 🎓 Background

I am a **Computer Science and Engineering graduate** with professional exposure to **data analytics, data pipelines, and backend data services**.

I initially explored **Cyber Security and Digital Forensics**, which helped build a strong foundation in systems, databases, and structured problem-solving. Through academic work, internships, and industry experience, I discovered a stronger interest in **working with data**—cleaning it, querying it, and transforming it into insights that support decision-making.

## 🧠 What I Have Worked On

Across professional and project-based work, I have experience with:

- Designing and maintaining **data pipelines** for structured datasets  
- Data extraction, preprocessing, normalization, and feature engineering  
- Writing **analytical SQL queries** for reporting and insight generation  
- Building **backend services** to expose analytical outputs via APIs  
- Automating data ingestion and processing workflows  
- Working with real-world, messy data and improving data quality
